# Practicum Data Science Project
## Analyzing Customer Default Risk

This project is done to help the credit department of a bank. The task is to investigate the influence of a customer's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of defaulting on loan repayments. The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of customers. Credit assessment is used to evaluate the ability of potential borrowers to repay their loans.

The objective of this project is to answer these questions:
* Is there a relationship between having children and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
* Is there a relationship between marital status and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
* Is there a relationship between income level and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
* How does the difference in loan purposes affect the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
